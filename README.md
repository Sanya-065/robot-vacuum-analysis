# robot-vacuum-analysis
üìä Project Overview
This project presents a comprehensive Power BI dashboard for analyzing data from a robot vacuum cleaner, offering insights into its performance, cleaning patterns, and maintenance metrics. The dashboard is designed for users, analysts, and stakeholders interested in understanding how efficiently the robot operates in various home environments.
üîç Objectives
Analyze cleaning duration, area covered, and battery usage.

Visualize room-wise cleaning distribution.

Monitor error logs, obstacle encounters, and docking efficiency.

Provide data-driven insights to improve robot scheduling and coverage.

Key Dashboard Features
Overview Cards: Total area cleaned, average duration, total sessions, battery usage trend.

Time Series Graphs: Weekly/monthly cleaning patterns.

Room Analysis: Heatmaps showing cleaning frequency by room.

Battery Analysis: Battery efficiency before and after each session.

Error Log Visuals: Common issues with occurrence trends.
 Tools & Technologies
Power BI for dashboard creation and data modeling.

Excel/CSV as data source (replaceable with IoT export from smart devices).

Optional: Python (Pandas) for data preprocessing before import.
